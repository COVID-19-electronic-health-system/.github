Git/Github Info

[A successful Git branching model](https://nvie.com/posts/a-successful-git-branching-model/)

From git-tower:
"In Git, the rebase command integrates changes from one branch into another. It is an alternative to the better known "merge" command.

Most visibly, rebase differs from merge by rewriting the commit history in order to produce a straight, linear succession of commits."

See [What is a rebase in Git?](https://www.git-tower.com/learn/git/glossary/rebase)

[Overview of `rebase`.](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/rewriting-history/git-rebase)

[How to use `rebase`.](https://help.github.com/en/github/using-git/using-git-rebase-on-the-command-line)

Why do we prefer rebase versus merge?
"Some people prefer to go without such automatic merge commits. Instead, they want the project's history to look as if it had evolved in a single, straight line. No indication remains that it had been split into multiple branches at some point."

‚ö†Ô∏è üëÄ **WARNING:**
You should use rebase only for squashing YOUR local commits prior to a pull request. DO NOT ever to rebase commits that have already been published to master. This will rewrite our public project's history. This applies to maintainers of the project.

Read this EXCELLENT article on [Rebase as an Alternative to Merge](https://www.git-tower.com/learn/git/ebook/en/desktop-gui/advanced-topics/rebase#start) from git-tower.
