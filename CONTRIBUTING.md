## About the Project

❤️ By the community, for the community. ❤️

We are building an open source progressive web application to help reduce the number of unnecessary hospital visits, educate the public on facts vs myths, and provide a health and well-being chart for logging their journey during the Coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic.

### Project Values

Our mission is to develop social good through technology. We value initiative, collaboration, experimentation, and integrity.

We are a welcoming, warm, and collaborative group of people from all over the world! Here you can experiment and take chances.

To FAIL is to make your First Attempt In Learning, and we are here to help. We encourage developers to learn new concepts and best practices while collaborating on a project that is scaling to help mankind against COVID-19.

### Townhall Meetings

We hold weekly townhall meetings on Saturdays, from 12:00pm EST to 12:30pm EST.

The typical agenda is:

1. Team leads will give an update
2. Discuss project roadmap
3. Discuss project deadlines
4. Discuss action items for current goals

If you have any questions or need any additional information, please discuss it with the team [on our Discord server.]()
